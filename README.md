A few things:

1) If you don't have Python, install Python 2.7 for your OS from https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/

2) Check to see if you have 'pip' installed. If you don't, look at this https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

3) Go to the directory where you've cloned these files. From the command line, run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

4) To run the program, write in the command line 'python ./simplequery.py' or 'python2.7 ./simplequery.py'
